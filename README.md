Practice with diagnostic log
## Basics
 - As a user
    - Displays “Greetings, UW!"
 - As a developer
    - Writes “on{event-name} event fired” to the INFO level of the diagnostic log for this application, including additional data with that event if applicable.
    - Write “We’re going down, Captain!” to the ERROR level of the diagnostic log in response to the onDestroy event, when closes.
## Additional Info
 - Screenshots of the app running on emulators included in "screenshots" folder
